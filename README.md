- Hold left mouse button and drag to see the scene from different angles
- Hold right mouse button and drag to move the scene horizontally
- Press `M` on keyboard to switch between the two motions for giraffe
- Double click with mouse anywhere on screen to create a new air dancer at (x, y) of the mouse click, with a randomized z plane
- Press `X` on keyboard to change the moving directions of all air dancers
